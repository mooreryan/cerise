Cerise is both a deep, reddish-pink color and a pipeline for speeding up homology searches without compromising precision and recall ([Nasko et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1101/426098)).

Cerise is heavily inspired by [Rubble](https://github.com/dnasko/rubble), the original pipeline from the Nasko mansucript.  The Rubble pipeline only allows clustering of the target sequences, and only supports homology searches with BLAST.  Cerise expands on Rubble by allowing clustering of both query and target sequences and supporting multiple homology search tools.
